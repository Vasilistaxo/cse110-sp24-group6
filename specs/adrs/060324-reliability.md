# Reliabilty

## Context and Problem Statement
How will we improve our website's reliability by providing offline access? 

## Considered options:
- Electron JS
- Service Workers

### Summary and Reasoning of Options

## Electron JS


## Service Workers

## Decision Outcome:
We decided to go with Service workers to improve our website's reliability. We chose service workers over Electron JS because we, as a group
are more familiar with Service Worker as we used it in the lab. This way, we do not have to spend additional time getting used to Electron JS.
