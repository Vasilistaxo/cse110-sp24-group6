# Build site with to-do list, daily log, and projects tab 
## Context and Problem Statement 
What features should we add to enhance the users' experiences? What features are a must, and what are desired? 
## Considered Options
* To-do list
* Daily log
* Progress bar
* Projects
* Note taking
* Vision board 
## Decision Outcome
**Chosen options**: to-do list to keep track of items; daily log to provide a recap of the day and help ground focus; projects tab for organization; and progress bar to visualize progress which can help with motivation.

We felt these were the most useful features to have, and while a vision board or a place to take notes would be nice additions, they were unnecessary and would detract from the dev journal's ultimate  purpose.
