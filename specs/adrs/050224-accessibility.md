## Context and Problem Statement 
Who is our target audience? How can we make the dev journal accessible to them?
## Considered Options
* **Dark mode** to ease the eyes 
* **Different font sizes**: options to increase the font so that the text is easier to read
* **Text is read aloud**
* **Reminders** to help those with poor memory 
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Different font sizes" and "reminders" as we felt these would help the most people and would not be completely out of our skill set as programmers either
