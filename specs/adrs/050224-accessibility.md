#  Accessibility features 
## Context and Problem Statement 
Who is our target audience? How can we make the dev journal accessible to them?
## Considered Options
* Different font sizes
* Text is read aloud
* Reminders
* Different language options
## Decision Outcome
**Chosen options**: different font sizes so that users can adjust to their needs, and reminders for those that are prone to forget tasks easily. 

We believe these features in particular would impact the largest percentage of our users.
