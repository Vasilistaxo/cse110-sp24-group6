# Getting Rid of Login Page 

## Context and Problem Statement

Initially, we planned to code a login page so that users could use the dev journal across all platforms and it would save their tasks, logs, etc. However, given the time constraints as well as our team's inexperience with backend programming, we were faced with the decision to keep the login page, risking the quality of our page and investing a lot of our time into it, or scrapping the idea. 

## Considered Options
* Constructing a login/register page 
* Not implementing a login/register page

## Thought Processes 

**Chosen option**: Integrate the Projects view into the homepage dashboard

### Description of Options

#### Constructing a login and register page 
A login and register page will allow users to input their information and take them to their personalized dashboard

**Advantages:**
- Can be used across all platforms/device types and would save user's progress since the data is linked to their account, not their device 
- Would implement using indexedDB which has slightly more options in terms of storage

**Disadvantages:**
- Out of our team's skill set to implement
- Would require a lot of time and resources and take away resources/contributions to other pages/features


#### Not implementing a login and register page 
Users are not able to login and register - their data will be stored to their device rather than account 

**Advantages:**
- Easier workload on all team members
- Gives members the chance to focus and develop their frontend skills rather than learning so many new systems in such a short span of time 
  
**Disadvantages:**
- Users are limited to their device 

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Not implementing a login/register page 

### Reasons for Choosing to Integrate into the Homepage Dashboard

1. **Resource Constraints**: Implementing a login/register page requires a lot of backend knowledge, and none of our team member has experience with backend programming. There is also not enough time to learn this skill and implement it successfully while still keeping up with other tasks, schoolwork, work, etc.
2. **Room for Error**: Because of the lack of experience, there is too much room for mishaps and errors in testing, and it could completely block users from interacting with our page.
3. **Priority of Features**: A login page is not essential to our dev journal application, and while it would be a nice addition, it is not a feature that needs priority.
