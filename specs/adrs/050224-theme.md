# Theme for dev journal 
## Context and Problem Statement 
Our goal is to create a dev journal that is fun and inspiring but not overcomplicated and confusing. 
## Considered options 
* **Plant**: each task completed helps the plant grow
* **Pokemon style**: collect different animals for each task completed
* **Animal**: feed and take care of your pet by completing tasks 
## Decision Outcome 
Chosen option: "Animal", because it keeps with our team's logo (otter) and motivates users of the journal to keep their pet alive
