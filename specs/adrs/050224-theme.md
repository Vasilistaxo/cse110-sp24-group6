# Otter theme for dev journal 
## Context and Problem Statement 
Our goal is to create a dev journal that is fun and inspiring but not overcomplicated and confusing. 
## Considered options 
* Plant mode where each task completed provides water for the plant
* Pokemon style where users  can collect different animals for each task completed
* Pet mode where users feed and take care of their pet by completing tasks 
## Decision Outcome 
**Chosen option**: Pet mode, as this would keep with our theme (otter) and incentivize users to finish tasks and keep the otter alive
