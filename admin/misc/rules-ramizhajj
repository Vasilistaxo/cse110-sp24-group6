# Team Working Agreement - Spring 2024


## Communication/Participation
- Regularly check and read Slack messages and respond to direct questions within 48 hours. 
- Maintain a positive and constructive environment. Keep all interactions respectful. 
- Workload should be delegated evenly. Members are expected to actively participate in group projects and assignments.
- Communicate any and all issues (missing a deadline, meeting absences, etc.) to group leaders immediately.

## Meetings 
- Attend weekly meetings, which will be scheduled at least 48 hours in advance. Meetings will be hybrid.
- Provide regular progress updates and be honest about the ability to meet deadlines.

## Conflict Resolution 
- If a member fails to uphold attendance and participation expectations (e.g. inactivity on Slack, unexcused absences, or failure to meet deadline):
  - Group leaders will hold a check-in meeting with the member to set new deadlines, create action plan, and remind member of team expectations.  
  - If the issue persists, then group leaders will contact TA.
- If a member has an issue with another member:
  - First, members will address the issue with involved parties. Keep encounters respectful and be mindful of language used. 
  - If confrontation does not work, group leaders will get involved and have a discussion with both parties.
  - If the issue persists, then group leaders will contact TA. 

## Team Signatures
I, Ramiz Hajj, agree to adhere to the rules listed above.
