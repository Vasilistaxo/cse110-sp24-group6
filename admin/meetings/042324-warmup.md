## **Summary**


**Decisions Made:**

**Project**: Sentiment Rating Widget

How do we want to make it?

Angry, Sad, Neutral, Happy Dinosaur!

What should the features be? (pretty basic)- it can have a rating meter, or just 3 emojis, or a star rating... etc

- Prompt user: How do you feel?
- Show this pop-up
- Option to NOT give the sentiment rating
- Rate your experiennce: instead of stars, have eggs- rate from 1 egg to 5 eggs- and whatever they click, a dinosaur should pop up.
