## Summary

- Very productive brainstorming session
- Tooles used- Miro, whiteboarding, Google form for understanding everyone's skill level and getting opinions on teamwork.
- Spent a lot of time deciding different features- made mindmaps on Miro to decide features and their details- threw ideas around.
- Created user stories and personas and decided to cut down on the unnecessary features- also focussed more on the "journal" aspect of the website. Initially we were just listing features that would be useful to have in a tool that boosts your productivity. On understanding the user personas and a "user's persepctive", we decided to focus more on the task at hand.
- Made use of the **iron triangle** principle to decide what features are possible and achievable and removed the ones that are impossible to do in such a short time.
- Used whiteboarding for design ideas and what our dev journal would look like and make wireframes informally.
- Created a user flowchart in order to formalize how we want the website to work and detail out how the user can interact with it.
- Decided on design aspects like color, theme, and make sure that it is consistent throughout the website.
- Made sure to incorporate our branding in the dev journal (using our mascot- an otter).
- Decided on when to meet for the pitch and assigned a few additional tasks to do before that!

All evidences of our work can be found in the [brainstorming directory](../../specs/brainstorm/).
