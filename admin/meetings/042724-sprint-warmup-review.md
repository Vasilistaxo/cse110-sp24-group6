**Initial planning and kick-off assignments**

The initial planning was crucial in bonding together as a team and getting to know everyone. All members were active during this phase!

This part included our first time working on technical tasks together. It was challenging to coordinate with 11 people but we came up with a great project in the end!

Everyone collorated on brainstorming and coming up with ideas for all aspects. Members were active on Slack and were present in our team meetings. All members were quick to give feedback and were active throughout. Great teamwork!

## Next steps

1. Work together to brainstorm new ideas for our final project
2. Complete our retrospective document and reflect on how we can improve the process
3. Relook at our workflow and process and see where we can make improvements
